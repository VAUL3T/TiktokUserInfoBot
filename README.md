How to use Â¿
----------------------
/start = Search user by username 

/id = Search user by user ID 

## How is your informaion managed 

As we said we do not collect any data , but if you are being rate limited or request an anti rate limit you are still ram-saved 

### Rate-Limit 

| Saved | Time  |
|----------|------|
| rate limit  | `until rate limit is over` |
| anti rate  | `user saved until you request an removal` |
| blacklist | `user saved until you request an removal`


#### Logs

we have a small debug system that logs things like "/start executed" for debug reasons 

in these logs no data is displayed 

|                               | Displayed ? | 
|-------------------------------|:-------:|
| Who                           |    ðŸ”´    |  
| Time.                         |    ðŸ”´    |  
| Command                       |    ðŸŸ¢    |
| User ID                       |    ðŸ”´    | 
| Username                      |    ðŸ”´    | 

unlike other services we dont log any user data at all 


we dont know who you are searching , who you are and when you searched 

> [!NOTE]
> Logs are only visible until server shutdown , no logfile is created evertything is only printed into the console
